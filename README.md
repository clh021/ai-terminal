# AI-Terminal

AI-Terminal is an advanced AI-powered CLI that enhances terminal workflows through AI-driven automation and
optimization. It efficiently manages tasks such as file management, data processing, and system diagnostics.

## Key Features

- **Contextual Assistance:** Learns from user commands to provide syntax suggestions.

- **Intelligent Search:** Conducts searches within files, directories, and specific file types.
- **Error Correction:** Corrects incorrect commands and suggests alternatives.
- **Custom Integrations:** Supports integration with various tools and services via plugins or APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go version v1.22.0 or higher.

### Installation

Install using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install coding-hui/tap/ai-terminal
```

Or, download it:

- [Packages][releases] are available in Debian and RPM formats
- [Binaries][releases] are available for Linux, macOS, and Windows

[releases]: https://github.com/coding-hui/ai-terminal/releases

Or, build from source (requires Go 1.22+):

```sh
make build
```

Then initialize configuration:
```sh
ai configure
```

<details>
<summary>Shell Completions</summary>

All packages and archives come with pre-generated completion files for Bash,
ZSH, Fish, and PowerShell.

If you built it from source, you can generate them with:

```bash
ai completion bash -h
ai completion zsh -h
ai completion fish -h
ai completion powershell -h
```

If you use a package (like Homebrew, Debs, etc), the completions should be set
up automatically, given your shell is configured properly.
